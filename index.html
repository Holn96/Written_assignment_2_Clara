    <p class="info">We have created an algorithm in the coding language JavaScript which sorts the number of 
        returns from a dataset which describes book purchases. This algorithm is designed to retrieve 
        data from a cleaned CSV-file of our dataset and aggregate it by book title and number of 
        returned purchases. It also presents the aggregated data in an HTML table with two variables; 
        book title and number of returns, each book title given a row in the table. </p>
        
       <p class="info">We have 
        described our algorithm in pseudocode, which can be found on our 'Algorithm' page along with 
        the table showing the final result. You can find the cleaned version of our dataset which we 
        used for the algorithm on the 'Dataset' page, as well as our thought processes during this 
        assignment which can be found on our 'Motivation' page. Finally we have added an 'About us' 
        page which gives some additional information about the members responsible for this project.</p>
