    <h1>The selection of dataset</h1>
    <p>
        The selection of the appropriate dataset is crucial for any data-driven project. This is why we paid a considerable amount of attention in the selection of dataset. 
        The dataset that we selected is relevant to our problem statement and it contains variables that impact our area of interest. We decided to find patterns and 
        probabilities in the return orders by analyzing the dataset. 
    </p>
    

<p>The dataset that we selected contains the following characteristics. </p>
<h3>Quality:</h3> 
<p>It was achieved by cleaning the data from anomalies and raw data. We created a tool by using C# programming language to clean the data. </p>
<h3>Relevance to Problem Statement:</h3>
<p>The dataset should be directly related to the problem or question one is trying to solve. This dataset is about orders and its properties that we need to reach 
    the answer to our problem statement.</p>
<h3>Size and Sufficiency:</h3>
<p>The dataset needs to be large enough to provide statistical significance. On the other hand, if it is too small, it may not reflect the pattern in the dataset which can 
    lead to inaccurate conclusions. Therefore, the dataset we selected has a reasonable size containing around ten thousands records.</p>
<h3>Privacy and Compliance: </h3>
<p>The dataset is freely available for educational purpose, and we did not violate any regulations like GDPR or licensing terms.</p>
