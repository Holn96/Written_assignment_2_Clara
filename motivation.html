    <h2>CURATING DATASET</h2>
    <p>
        The selection of the appropriate dataset is crucial for any data-driven project. This is why we paid a considerable amount of attention in the selection of dataset. 
        The dataset that we selected is relevant to our problem statement and it contains variables that impact our area of interest. We decided to find patterns and 
        probabilities in the return orders by analyzing the dataset. 
    </p>
    <p>The dataset that we selected contains the following characteristics. </p>
<h3>Quality:</h3> 
<p>It was achieved by cleaning the data from anomalies and raw data. We created a tool by using C# programming language to clean the data. </p>
<h3>Relevance to Problem Statement:</h3>
<p>The dataset should be directly related to the problem or question one is trying to solve. This dataset is about orders and its properties that we need to reach 
    the answer to our problem statement.</p>
<h3>Size and Sufficiency:</h3>
<p>The dataset needs to be large enough to provide statistical significance. On the other hand, if it is too small, it may not reflect the pattern in the dataset which can 
    lead to inaccurate conclusions. Therefore, the dataset we selected has a reasonable size containing around ten thousands records.</p>
<h3>Privacy and Compliance: </h3>
<p>The dataset is freely available for educational purpose, and we did not violate any regulations like GDPR or licensing terms.</p>

    <h2>CREATING WEBSITE</h2>
        <p>Using HTML and CSS when designing this website, we started off by creating a simple 
        homepage with a navigation bar, as well as four additional web pages which we link to 
        in our homepage. Our first concern has been to create a website which is functional and 
        will allow us to accomplish our assignment. This means using HTML to create headers for 
        easy navigation, making a table which fits our curated dataset and adding our algorithm 
        and additional information about our work. Our second concern has been to add CSS in order 
        to improve some of the visuals and the layout of the website. This has been an opportunity 
        to try out different solutions using HTML and CSS in order to make the website easier to 
        navigate, and throughout this process we have used W3 Schools as a source of inspiration. 
        By using the site’s many tutorials we have been able to learn more about how to apply HTML 
        and CSS, making adjustments in order to fit our specific needs. For example, W3 Schools 
        have tutorials on how to make so-called “cards” in HTML and CSS, which we have adapted for 
        our “About Us” page. This has been especially useful when the members of our group come from 
        different backgrounds, and not necessarily on equal footing when it comes to using these 
        languages. </p>
