    <h2>CREATING WEBSITE</h2>
        <p>Using HTML and CSS when designing this website, we started off by creating a simple 
        homepage with a navigation bar, as well as four additional web pages which we link to 
        in our homepage. Our first concern has been to create a website which is functional and 
        will allow us to accomplish our assignment. This means using HTML to create headers for 
        easy navigation, making a table which fits our curated dataset and adding our algorithm 
        and additional information about our work. Our second concern has been to add CSS in order 
        to improve some of the visuals and the layout of the website. This has been an opportunity 
        to try out different solutions using HTML and CSS in order to make the website easier to 
        navigate, and throughout this process we have used W3 Schools as a source of inspiration. 
        By using the site’s many tutorials we have been able to learn more about how to apply HTML 
        and CSS, making adjustments in order to fit our specific needs. For example, W3 Schools 
        have tutorials on how to make so-called “cards” in HTML and CSS, which we have adapted for 
        our “About Us” page. This has been especially useful when the members of our group come from 
        different backgrounds, and not necessarily on equal footing when it comes to using these 
        languages. </p>
